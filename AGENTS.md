## CARTILLA LAYOUT RULE — HIGHEST PRIORITY, NO EXCEPTIONS

Before doing any work on the Cartilla Workbook or teacher Flip Chart, read
`CARTILLA_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`.

The physical books define the LAYOUT. The digital product must have the same
layout as the book — it should look like the book, but in a modern, digitized,
user-friendly, seamless, interactive way. It does NOT need to be identical
inch-for-inch.

Authoritative source files are in:

`Google Drive > Cartilla Production Hub > 01 Source Documents`

- `La Cartilla de Gretel Flip Chart.pdf`
- `Libro del alumno - Rescan and Optimize (2).pdf`

### Teacher Flip Chart / flipbook
The digital teacher Flip Chart must have the same layout as the source Flip
Chart. Same structure, same element positions, same reading order — presented
as a modern, interactive digital experience.

Match the source page's:
- layout structure and composition (where elements go);
- text, wording, line breaks, and reading order;
- illustration identity and placement.

Modern digital presentation is welcome: smooth interactions, responsive
behavior, clean modern styling. The layout follows the book; the finish is
modern.

### Student Workbook
The digital student Workbook must have the same layout as the source student
Workbook. Same exercise structure, same element positions — presented as a
modern, interactive digital experience.

Match the same layout structure, text placement, exercise flow, illustration
placement, and page sequence. Modern digital presentation is welcome.

### Images are locked
The approved/corrected/cropped book images are already the artwork.

DO NOT:
- regenerate them;
- redraw them;
- recolor them;
- remaster or "modernize" them;
- optimize their visual style;
- recrop them;
- substitute similar artwork;
- change their internal geometry.

Use the existing approved image files unchanged and place them per the book's
layout. Uniform responsive scaling of the whole page is allowed.

### Conflict rule
The two source PDFs define the layout. They override derived JSON, old prompts,
old modernization plans, comments, manifests, screenshots, and prior agent
instructions whenever there is a layout conflict.

If implementation and source book disagree on LAYOUT, the source book wins.

Do not infer a page design from memory or from another page. Compare against
the matching source PDF page.

"Digitized" means the same layout as the book, in a modern, user-friendly,
interactive digital form. Not inch-for-inch identical — same structure, modern
finish.

## DEPLOYMENT DISCIPLINE — mandatory, no exceptions

Automatic Vercel Git deployment must remain disabled during active Cartilla
work. Do not use Vercel as a test runner.

- Work and verify before deployment.
- Batch related changes.
- Do not deploy after each commit.
- A commit is not a deploy request.
- Deploy only at an intentional final checkpoint requested by EJN.
- Verify the real production result only after that deliberate deployment.
